PACKAGE SUMMARY:
This was created using the Tkinter framework and Pillow library. The purpose
of this code was to show that you can edit photos with a user interface.
Although this is still in the works, here is a brief usage of both of the 
frameworks/libraries. 

The Tkinter framework is a basic Python GUI that allows the user to create
a user interface. It allows users to interact with a user interface so that
they can interact with menus, buttons, etc.

The Pillow library allows users to edit images such as blurring, rotating,
coloring, etc. Pillow also allows opening, manipulating, and saving images.

The reason why I am using these two libraries is because I want to create a
photo editor with these two libraries. The code attached to this (imageEditor.py)
is still in the works and beginning stages, so more features will be added soon, such
as adding your own images from your personal computer, saving the edited image, etc.


HOW TO RUN:
To run this code, please click on the run button and click on either button
from the UI. The blur button shows the initial image and then the blurred
image. The rotate button shows the initial image and then the rotated version.


HOW CODE WORKS:
The code is very simple to understand - I created three buttons that have three
different features.

The "Blur" button shows the original unedited image, following the blured version of
the same image.

The "Rotate" button shows the original unedited image as well, following up with a rotated
version of the original image.

The "Close" button closes out of the program.

Future Idea:
My future idea is to create a photo editor with these two libraries, and I will add more 
features such as saving the edited image, having more editing features, opening your own
personal images, etc.
